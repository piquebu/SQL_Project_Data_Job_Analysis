## 5. Top-Paying Skills for Data Analysts

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

*(TLDR: Big Data & Cloud Skills Dominate)*

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

- **PySpark ($208K), Databricks ($141K), Airflow ($126K), GCP ($122K)** ‚Üí These indicate that expertise in big data processing and cloud platforms is highly valued.
Companies are investing in distributed computing for handling massive datasets.
Version Control & DevOps Matter

- **Bitbucket ($189K), GitLab ($154K), Jenkins ($125K), Kubernetes ($132K)** ‚Üí High salaries for DevOps and CI/CD tools show that data analysts with engineering skills are in demand.
Jenkins & Kubernetes hint at integration with machine learning models in production.
AI & Machine Learning Boost Salaries

- **DataRobot ($155K), Scikit-Learn ($125K), Watson ($160K)** ‚Üí AI-focused platforms and frameworks are paying well.
AI-driven automation in analytics is becoming a key differentiator for high earners.
Programming & Data Processing Still King

- **Python Libraries (Pandas $151K, Numpy $143K, Jupyter $152K, Scikit-Learn $125K)** ‚Üí Strong Python-based skills are highly paid, reinforcing Python‚Äôs dominance in analytics.
Scala ($124K) and Golang ($145K) suggest backend & performance-heavy analytics roles also pay well.
BI & Analytics Tools Are Still Valuable

- **PostgreSQL ($123K), MicroStrategy ($121K), Notion ($125K)** ‚Üí SQL-based skills remain relevant, while modern BI tools (like Notion) are gaining traction.
Conclusion:
High-paying data analysts are those who blend data engineering, AI, and DevOps skills into their toolkit.
Cloud, automation, and big data expertise lead to higher salaries.
Pure analytics skills (BI, SQL) are still valuable but not at the highest tier.

### Why it matters?
- High-performance languages (Golang) and CI/CD tools (Jenkins) cater to roles blending analytics with software engineering.

### Key Takeaways
- **Cloud + Big Data = $$$:** Skills in cloud platforms (GCP) and distributed systems (PySpark) are 20‚Äì30% higher than traditional BI tools.

- **Remote Work Premium:** DevOps/AI skills are disproportionately rewarded in remote roles, likely due to their alignment with scalable, automated workflows.

- **Beyond Dashboards:** While SQL/BI tools (PostgreSQL: $123K, Tableau: Not in top 50) are foundational, they lag behind engineering-focused skills.

### Recommendations
- **Upskill in Cloud Platforms:** Certifications in GCP/AWS or Databricks can boost salary potential.

- **Learn Automation Tools:** Master Airflow for pipeline orchestration or Kubernetes for deployment.

- **Bridge the AI Gap:** Add Scikit-Learn or Watson to your toolkit to stay competitive.
